# Disaster Tweet Classification
Project to solve the problem stated in [Kaggle: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)
Followed Google TensorFlow work [Classify text with BERT](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/classify_text_with_bert), and eventually deployed the solution as a web api to Amazon AWS EC2. Used BERT NLP pre-trained model because it is relatively newer model for sentiment analysis with more sophisticated deep learning framework(attention, transfomer) that should provider higher accuracy.
